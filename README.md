## ðŸ”¹ Behavioral Design Patterns

### 1. Observer Pattern  
**Use Case:**  
A YouTube-like subscription system where users subscribe to channels and get notified when new content is uploaded.  

**Relation to Pattern:**  
Observer pattern allows **subjects (channels)** to notify **observers (subscribers)** about state changes (new content).  

**Classes:**  
- `Content` â€“ Represents the video or content uploaded to a channel.  
- `Subscriber` â€“ Observer that receives notifications when new content is posted.  
- `User` â€“ Represents a subscriber entity.  
- `Channel` â€“ Subject interface that defines subscription management.  
- `YouTubeChannel` â€“ Concrete subject, manages subscribers and notifies them about updates.  
- `YouTubeMain` â€“ Main class to demonstrate the observer workflow.  


### 2. Strategy Pattern  
**Use Case:**  
A flexible notification system (Email, SMS, WhatsApp, Push) that can be changed at runtime.  

**Relation to Pattern:**  
Strategy pattern defines multiple algorithms (notification methods) and switches between them without altering client code.  

**Classes:**  
- `NotificationService` â€“ Strategy interface for notification.  
- `EmailNotification` â€“ Sends notifications via email.  
- `SMSNotification` â€“ Sends notifications via SMS.  
- `WhatsAppNotification` â€“ Sends notifications via WhatsApp.  
- `PushNotification` â€“ Sends notifications via push alerts.  
- `NotificationClient` â€“ Client that selects and executes a notification strategy.  
- `Main` â€“ Main class to demonstrate the strategy pattern in action.  


## ðŸ”¹ Structural Design Patterns  

### 1. Adapter Pattern  
**Use Case:**  
Modernizing an old attendance system with a new fingerprint-based system while maintaining compatibility.  

**Relation to Pattern:**  
Adapter pattern bridges the old system and the new system, allowing integration without modifying the old code.  

**Classes:**  
- `OldAttendanceSystem` â€“ Represents the legacy attendance system.  
- `AttendanceSystem` â€“ Adapter interface that defines new system operations.  
- `NewAttendanceSystem` â€“ Adapter implementation bridging old and new systems.  
- `Student` â€“ Represents a student whose attendance is tracked.  
- `Main` â€“ Demonstrates the adapter pattern.


### 2. Proxy Pattern  
**Use Case:**  
A secure banking service with logging and security checks before accessing real banking services (deposit, withdraw).  

**Relation to Pattern:**  
Proxy pattern controls access to the real service by adding extra features (logging, security).  

**Classes:**  
- `UserBank` â€“ Represents a user in the banking system.  
- `BankService` â€“ Service interface for banking operations.  
- `RealBankService` â€“ Actual banking service implementation.  
- `ProxyBankService` â€“ Proxy that adds logging and security checks before accessing `RealBankService`.  
- `Main` â€“ Demonstrates proxy functionality.  


## ðŸ”¹ Creational Design Patterns  

### 1. Factory Pattern  
**Use Case:**  
Creating different types of home appliances (Microwave, Refrigerator, Washing Machine) using a factory.  

**Relation to Pattern:**  
Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects, letting subclasses decide which appliance to create.  

**Classes:**  
- `HomeAppliance` â€“ Abstract product representing appliances.  
- `Microwave` â€“ Concrete product.  
- `Refrigerator` â€“ Concrete product.  
- `WashingMachine` â€“ Concrete product.  
- `HomeApplianceFactory` â€“ Abstract factory for creating appliances.  
- `MicrowaveFactory` â€“ Creates `Microwave` objects.  
- `RefrigeratorFactory` â€“ Creates `Refrigerator` objects.  
- `WashingMachineFactory` â€“ Creates `WashingMachine` objects.  
- `Client` â€“ Requests appliances through factories.  
- `Main` â€“ Demonstrates the factory pattern.  


### 2. Prototype Pattern  
**Use Case:**  
Duplicating different types of documents (PPT, Report, Resume) efficiently without recreating from scratch.  

**Relation to Pattern:**  
Prototype pattern allows cloning existing documents, useful when object creation is costly.  

**Classes:**  
- `Document` â€“ Abstract prototype defining clone behavior.  
- `PPT` â€“ Concrete prototype for PowerPoint files.  
- `Report` â€“ Concrete prototype for reports.  
- `Resume` â€“ Concrete prototype for resumes.  
- `DocumentClient` â€“ Client that clones documents.  
- `Main` â€“ Demonstrates prototype cloning.  


## ðŸ”¹ Utils  
Utility classes used throughout the project:  
- `AppLogger` â€“ Singleton logger for consistent logging.  
- `TransientError` â€“ Represents temporary system errors.  
- `TransientException` â€“ Custom exception for transient error handling.
